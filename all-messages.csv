Alexander Lee,  check out this bot I made
Vladimir,  impressive
Alexander Lee,  I have a legal question: could an agreement between a legal entity such as a multinational corporation and a government be considered a international agreement?
Alexander Lee,"  I don't think it can be because an international agreement is something that regulates behavior between two states, i.e. in order for an agreement to be considered an international agreement both signing parties need to have some sort of international recognition as being a sovereign state."
Vladimir,  Missed video call
Vladimir,  I have some ideas. Call me when you’re free.
Alexander Lee,  Let's talk tomorrow.
